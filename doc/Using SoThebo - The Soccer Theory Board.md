# Using SoTheBo - The Soccer Theory Board
## Getting Started
SoTheBo, The Soccer Theory Board, is a Pharo application to visually experiment on the Soccer Theory.
After opening the SoTheBo application, we see the main window consisting of the following parts from top to bottom:
* the window title
* the controls
* the play field
* the legend
* the status bar

The window's size is 1180 x 884 pixel. It is not resizable but maximizable (not recommended).
The play field has a fixed size of 1110 x 720 pixel without the border.

## Strategic aspects
  ### The play field
  The play field is intentionally unadorned.
  Neither the center circle nor the penalty boxes are relevant for the Soccer Theory.
  The field boundaries, the middle line and the goals are required.
  Each goal is painted with the color of the team defending it.
  The goal width is proportional to the world model.
  ### Strategic zones
  ### Player tags

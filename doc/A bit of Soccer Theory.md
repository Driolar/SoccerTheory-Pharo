# A bit of Soccer Theory
This is a summary of the Soccer Theory, explained in-depth in [this Wikiversity article](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/The_Theory_of_Soccer).
## Key strategical concepts of the soccer game
The essential strategical questions of the soccer game are:
* How can the team in possession get one of its players in free position and pass him the ball for scoring?
* How can the opposing team avoid it?
### The attack challenge: freeing the finisher
There is a basic need for team collaboration to pass the ball to the team-mate who is in the best position to score, let's call him the finisher. 
A very good opportunity to score is when the finisher is in a free position. 
In such a position, he wouldn’t be met by an opponent except the goalkeeper on his way to score. 
### The defence challenge: coverage
The defending team must prevent any opponent from getting into a free position and receiving the ball to finish successfully. 
It must subtly avoid the advance of any attacking player that has no ball at his feet. 
This defence challenge is called coverage.
A covered player won't advance until he perceives a propitious situation that might cause him or a team-mate to become uncovered.
## The Historical Evolution of the Soccer Offside Rule
Historically, soccer strategy is tightly related to the ruling offside law. 
The original offside rule was regulated to a game law in 1863, but it was in practice long before. 
It was substantially changed in 1866 and finally in 1925. This leaves the offside law still effective today.

According to the Theory of Soccer, there are three stable strategic systems in the evolution of soccer: the Ancient, the Classic and the Modern system.
They correspond to the three successive offside laws.

### The Ancient Offside Rule (1863)
In its primitive origins, soccer had only vague rules. 
It was more rude sport than game. Each participant disputed the ball possession selfishly. 
There was no sense of collaboration or game ordering.
Gradually leaving primitive soccer, soccer participants began to decide before starting the game which rules (number of players, pitch measures, duration, fouls,...) would be applied. 
Among the rules, there was one, called the offside rule, that restricted the advance of attacking players. 
It was an offence to pass the ball to a player at the time he was in a offside position. The *Ancient Offside Rule* stated:
> An attacking player is in offside position if he is more advanced than the ball.

Obeying the offside rule, which became official law in 1863, each team was obliged to stay behind the ball, as illustrated above. 
The attacking players without the ball couldn’t advance freely in order to receive a forward pass.
They were all covered.
### The Classic Offside Rule (1866)

### The Modern Offside Rule (1925)
## Conclusion
In past times, the coverage was entirely supported by the former offside laws. 
But the current offside law doesn’t guarantee the coverage.
Thus a non game rule related collaborative defence strategy must be applied in modern times.

# A bit of Soccer Theory
This is a summary of the Soccer Theory, explained in-depth in [this Wikiversity article](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/The_Theory_of_Soccer).
## Key Strategical Concepts of the Soccer Game
The essential strategical questions of the soccer game are:
* How can the team in possession get one of its players in free position and pass him the ball for scoring?
* How can the opposing team avoid it?
### The Attack Challenge: Freeing the Finisher
There is a basic need for team collaboration to pass the ball to the team-mate who is in the best position to score, let's call him the finisher. 
A very good opportunity to score is when the finisher is in a free position. 
In such a position, he wouldn’t be met by an opponent except the goalkeeper on his way to score. 
### The Defence Challenge: Coverage
The defending team must prevent any opponent from getting into a free position and receiving the ball to finish successfully. 
It must subtly avoid the advance of any attacking player that has no ball at his feet. 
This defence challenge is called coverage.
A covered player won't advance until he perceives a propitious situation that might cause him or a team-mate to become uncovered.
## The Historical Evolution of the Soccer Offside Rule
Historically, soccer strategy is tightly related to the ruling offside law. 
The original offside rule was regulated to a game law in 1863, but it was in practice long before. 
It was substantially changed in 1866 and finally in 1925. This leaves the offside law still effective today.

According to the Theory of Soccer, there are three stable strategic systems in the evolution of soccer: the Ancient, the Classic and the Modern system.
They correspond to the three successive offside laws.

### The Ancient Offside Rule (1863)
In its primitive origins, soccer had only vague rules. 
It was more rude sport than game. Each participant disputed the ball possession selfishly. 
There was no sense of collaboration or game ordering.
Gradually leaving primitive soccer, soccer participants began to decide before starting the game which rules (number of players, pitch measures, duration, fouls,...) would be applied. 
Among the rules, there was one, called the offside rule, that restricted the advance of attacking players. 
It was an offence to pass the ball to a player at the time he was in a offside position. The *Ancient Offside Rule* stated:
> An attacking player is in offside position if he is more advanced than the ball.

Obeying the offside rule, which became official law in 1863, each team was obliged to stay behind the ball, as illustrated above. 
The attacking players without the ball couldn’t advance freely in order to receive a forward pass.
They were all covered.
### The Classic Offside Rule (1866)
The offside law in ancient soccer restricted the attacking team collaboration greatly. 
To alleviate this, the *Classic Offside Rule* was invented in 1866:
> An attacking player is in offside position if he is more advanced than both the ball and the *antepenultimate* opponent.

The new offside law definition led gradually to the classic soccer system, where a remarkable phenomenon appeared: 
Only two defenders, besides the goalkeeper, were sufficient to manage the coverage controlling the advance of any number of attackers. 
One defender always opposed the attacker that had the ball and determined, by his position, the offside zone. 
The other defender was situated more backward, in the offside zone, being able to intercept any attacker that could enter the offside zone legally with the ball.

### The Modern Offside Rule (1925)
Although the classical system offered beautiful soccer for a long time, a crisis exploded in the English Professional League.
The number of goals and spectators decreased continuously. 
This was due to some defenders who provoked countless offside whistles with an offside trap. 
In 1925, officials decided to diminish the power of the law and redefined it to the *Modern Offside Rule* as follows:
> An attacking player is in offside position if he is more advanced than both the ball and the *penultimate* opponent.

This law definition is, with minor modifications, still in force.

Look at the diagram above. 
In the classic model, the defender who determined the offside line could stop the advance of all opponents, since another defender was behind him.
But with the new rule, there is no defender in the offside zone.
The player with the ball can pass it to a team-mate in free position to score.

A slight word modification – penultimate instead of antepenultimate – had an enormous impact: In its modern version, the offside law has ceased to be a sufficient, automatic defence strategy.

## Conclusion
In past times, the coverage was entirely supported by the former offside laws. 
But the current offside law doesn’t guarantee the coverage.
Thus a non offside rule related collaborative defence strategy must be applied in modern times.

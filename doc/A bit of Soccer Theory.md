# A bit of Soccer Theory
This is a summary of the Soccer Theory, explained in-depth in [this Wikiversity article](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/The_Theory_of_Soccer).
## Key strategical concepts of the soccer game
The essential strategical questions of the soccer game are:
* How can the team in possession get one of its players in free position and pass him the ball for scoring?
* How can the opposing team avoid it?
### The attack challenge: freeing the finisher
There is a basic need for team collaboration to pass the ball to the team-mate who is in the best position to score, let's call him the finisher. 
A very good opportunity to score is when the finisher is in a free position. 
In such a position, he wouldnâ€™t be met by an opponent except the goalkeeper on his way to score. 
### The defence challenge: coverage
The defending team must prevent any opponent from getting into a free position and receiving the ball to finish successfully. 
It must subtly avoid the advance of any attacking player that has no ball at his feet. 
This defence challenge is called coverage.
## The Historical Evolution of the Soccer Offside Rule
Historically, soccer strategy is tightly related to the ruling offside law. 
The original offside rule was regulated to a game law in 1863, but it was in practice long before. 
It was substantially changed in 1866 and finally in 1925. This leaves the offside law still effective today.

According to the Theory of Soccer, there are three stable strategic systems in the evolution of soccer: the Ancient, the Classic and the Modern system.
They correspond to the three successive offside laws.

### The Ancient Offside Rule (1863)

### The Classic Offside Rule (1866)

### The Modern Offside Rule (1925)

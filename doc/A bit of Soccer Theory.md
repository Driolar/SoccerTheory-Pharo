# The Historical Evolution of the Soccer Offside Rule

Historically, soccer strategy is tightly related to the ruling offside law. The original offside rule was regulated to a game law in 1863, but it was in practice long before. It was substantially changed in 1866 and finally in 1925. This leaves the offside law still effective today.

According to the Theory of Soccer, there are three stable strategic systems in the evolution of soccer: the Ancient, the Classic and the Modern system. They correspond to the three successive offside laws.

## The Ancient Offside Rule (1863)

## The Classic Offside Rule (1866)

## The Modern Offside Rule (1925)

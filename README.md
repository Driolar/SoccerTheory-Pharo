# SoccerTheory-Pharo
**SoTheBoard**, The Soccer Theory Board, is a software application to visualize the [Theory of Soccer](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/The_Theory_of_Soccer).
It is written in Pharo and is inspired by a [former master thesis implemented in Java](https://github.com/Driolar/SoccerTheory-Java).
There is some [user documentation](https://github.com/Driolar/SoccerTheory-Pharo/tree/master/doc) written for you.
